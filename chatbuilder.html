    <h1>Goals of this Projects</h1>
    <p>Congrats, You have all the tools you need to build your own chat client! Your goal in this project will be to create a chat application by using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery, and by making HTTP requests to a server in the background, via JavaScript. (You won't need to edit the server, that part is all handled for you.) You can see a working example version of the chat client at http://chatbuilder.hackreactor.com/chatbuilder.html?example=1.

    <p>We've provided 3 helper functions that can do most of the work for you at first, so you should start by figuring out how those work and building your client on top of them. Next, you'll be asked to delete those helpers and rebuild their functionality. By going in this order, you'll have a strong understanding of the project at a high level before you begin tackling the harder details. If you're new to developing for the web, you may find it useful to refer to the tutorials "Try jQuery" (http://try.jquery.com/) and "Explore and Master Chrome DevTools" (http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/).

    <p>Ok, get started! You'll need to complete each of the following steps, probably in this order since each one builds on the previous.
    <ol class="instructions">
   <li>Experiment with the  Chat.display()  helper</li>
   <li>Experiment with the  Chat.fetch()  helper</li>
    <li>Hook the two together</li>
    <li>Set your app up to refresh the list of messages every 3 seconds.</li>
    <li>Experiment with the  Chat.send()  helper</li>
    <li>Allow the user to enter their own chat messages via the input box.</li>
    <li>Woohoo, you're done with beginner phase--time to delete the helpers!</li>
    <li>Add  delete Chat.display;  as the first line of your JS.</li>
    <li>Add  delete Chat.fetch;  as the second line of your JS.</li>
    <li>Add  delete Chat.send;  as the third line of your JS.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can access more detailed explanations of each step by passing the step number into  Chat.guide() . When you need help, please reach out to your interviewer rather than a friend--We're happy to help!
